This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (versions 18 or higher)
- Npm

## Getting Started

Fork/clone the repository, install its dependencies and run the local dev server
on the root directory:

```console
git clone https://github.com/LinkTheCoder/SpaceOutCat.git
cd SpaceOutCat
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can now access http://localhost:3000 on your browser.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

```console
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YourKey
```
For production save your key in a server. 
Vercel for example has ```Environment Variables``` available to save keys. You can read more in their docs: [Vercel Documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables )

## firebaseConfig.js

Once you have created a Firebase project you will receive several id's and web links that needs to be added to the Firebase config file in the project to be able connect with the database.

```const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  authDomain: 'project.domain.com',
  projectId: 'ID',
  storageBucket: 'project.domain.com',
  messagingSenderId: 'MS ID',
  appId: 'APP ID',
